--Download and Play Instructions (from blog)--

If you have a PICO-8 console, you can download the .PNG file above and install it. Otherwise, you can download the file below and play it through a browser by opening shooter.html. There might be some input delay if you play through a browser.

To play the game:

Z - shoot
X - laser
Arrow keys - move
Scoring system:

Destroying enemies increases the multiplier, and increases enemy spawn rate. Enemy spawn rate currently does not decrease.
Using the laser decreases the multiplier.
Getting hit resets the multiplier.
The multiplier decreases after 180 frames, with time indicated by the blue bars in the upper left corner.
Higher multiplier gives a higher chance of spawning the stronger enemies
The game currently slows down when there are too many things on the screen. This intended, and will be tweaked as I experiment more.
